## Repository Info
This repo contains the **course project** in the **"Getting and Cleaning Data"** course in Data Science track on Coursera.

## File Info
The project work mainly as **4 files**: this README.md file, the R script [run_analysis.R](https://github.com/elegantcoderM/HumanActivityRecognitionSmartPhones/blob/master/run_analysis.R), [CodeBook.md](https://github.com/elegantcoderM/HumanActivityRecognitionSmartPhones/blob/master/CodeBook.md) and the [tidy data](https://github.com/elegantcoderM/HumanActivityRecognitionSmartPhones/blob/master/tidydata.txt) generated by running the R script (run_analysis.R) on the raw data in the repo.

Info regarding the raw data can be found in [README.txt](https://github.com/elegantcoderM/HumanActivityRecognitionSmartPhones/README.txt)

## Running the R script
The R script [run_analysis.R](https://github.com/elegantcoderM/HumanActivityRecognitionSmartPhones/blob/master/run_analysis.R) can be run on the raw data in the repo to generate the [tidy data](https://github.com/elegantcoderM/HumanActivityRecognitionSmartPhones/blob/master/tidydata.txt). To run the R script you would need [activity_labels.txt](https://github.com/elegantcoderM/HumanActivityRecognitionSmartPhones/blob/master/activity_labels.txt), [features.txt](https://github.com/elegantcoderM/HumanActivityRecognitionSmartPhones/blob/master/features.txt) and the test and train folders in the same directory level as the R script. The test and folders should contain the [data files](https://github.com/elegantcoderM/HumanActivityRecognitionSmartPhones/README.txt).
 
The R script does the following: 1) Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set. 2) Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 3) Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set. 4) Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 5) From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

R script uses plyr and dplyr libraries.

To generate the tidy data just source the R script.

## Tidy Data Output

The tidy data output is generated in the same directory as the R script. It contains the average of every **mean** and **standard deviation** variables in the raw data set for each **activity** and each **subject**. It has 180 rows and 68 columns. More info about the tidy data can be found in the [codebook](https://github.com/elegantcoderM/HumanActivityRecognitionSmartPhones/blob/master/CodeBook.md).
