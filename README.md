## Repository Info
This repo contains the **course project** in the **"Getting and Cleaning Data"** course in Data Science track on Coursera. Raw data collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone is processed and a tidy data is generated.

## File Info
The project work mainly as **4 files**: this README.md file, the R script [run_analysis.R](https://github.com/elegantcoderM/HumanActivityRecognitionSmartPhones/blob/master/run_analysis.R), [CodeBook.md](https://github.com/elegantcoderM/HumanActivityRecognitionSmartPhones/blob/master/CodeBook.md) and the [tidy data](https://github.com/elegantcoderM/HumanActivityRecognitionSmartPhones/blob/master/tidydata.txt) generated by running the R script (run_analysis.R) on the raw data in the repo.

Info regarding the raw data can be found in [README.txt](https://github.com/elegantcoderM/HumanActivityRecognitionSmartPhones/blob/master/README.txt)

## Running the R script
The R script [run_analysis.R](https://github.com/elegantcoderM/HumanActivityRecognitionSmartPhones/blob/master/run_analysis.R) can be run on the raw data in the repo to generate the [tidy data](https://github.com/elegantcoderM/HumanActivityRecognitionSmartPhones/blob/master/tidydata.txt). To run the R script you would need [activity_labels.txt](https://github.com/elegantcoderM/HumanActivityRecognitionSmartPhones/blob/master/activity_labels.txt), [features.txt](https://github.com/elegantcoderM/HumanActivityRecognitionSmartPhones/blob/master/features.txt) and the test and train folders in the same directory level as the R script. The test and folders should contain the [data files](https://github.com/elegantcoderM/HumanActivityRecognitionSmartPhones/blob/master/README.txt).
 
The R script does the following:

 1) Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set. To do this the script reads the test and train data sets separately as tables and merges them using *rbind()* and *cbind()* functions.

 2) Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names, getting the names from the file [features.txt](https://github.com/elegantcoderM/HumanActivityRecognitionSmartPhones/blob/master/features.txt). To do this read the features.txt and add update the column names of the data from step 1.

 3) Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. For this the data is transformed into *tbl* format and select function from *dplyr* library is used.

 4) Uses descriptive activity names from [activity_labels.txt](https://github.com/elegantcoderM/HumanActivityRecognitionSmartPhones/blob/master/activity_labels.txt) to name the activities in the data set. The activity names are read as a factor from activity_labels.txt and is applied on the activity column in the data.

 5) From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject. For this *ddply* function is used and the data from step 4 is grouped by activity and subject to generate this independent tidy data set.
 
 6) Generates the tidydata.txt file from the table generated in step 5 using the write.table function.

R script uses plyr and dplyr libraries.

To generate the tidy data just source the R script.

## Tidy Data Output

The tidy data output is generated in the same directory as the R script. It contains the average of every **mean** and **standard deviation** variables in the raw data set for each **activity** and each **subject**. It has 180 rows and 68 columns. More info about the tidy data can be found in the [codebook](https://github.com/elegantcoderM/HumanActivityRecognitionSmartPhones/blob/master/CodeBook.md).
